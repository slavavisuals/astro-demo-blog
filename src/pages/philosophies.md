## Minimalism

From decluttering to software development, minimalism has had a widespread impact on many areas of our lives. While the term “minimalism” was first coined to describe a post-WWII Western art movement, the term found itself applied in various contexts where there was a benefit to doing more with less.

Generally, minimalist philosophies value:

- Simplicity
- Utility
- Doing away with the unnecessary

Minimalism worked its way into software development in the 1970’s. In these early days of programming, developers worked to optimize programs within the constraints of limited hardware resources and budget. While our hardware capabilities and budgets have certainly grown since then, minimalism remains an influence in software design and development.

## Open-source philosophy

Open-source software is software that makes its source code available to the public. We owe today’s abundance of open-source software to open-source philosophy and the open-source-software movement in the 1990s.

The open-source philosophy is closely linked to the hacker ethic. Indeed, many open-source activists were hackers (a term with positive connotations in this context). Like the hacker ethic, the open-source philosophy believes software and information should be freely available to anyone who wishes to use or improve upon it.
