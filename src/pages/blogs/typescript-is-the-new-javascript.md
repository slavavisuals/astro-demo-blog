## JavaScript and More

TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

## A Result You Can Trust

TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

## Safety at Scale

TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
